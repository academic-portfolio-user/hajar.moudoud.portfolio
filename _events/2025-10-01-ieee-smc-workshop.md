I will be speaking at the IEEE SMC (Systems, Man, and Cybernetics) Workshop on AI and Cybersecurity: Friend or Foe? at SMC 2025, which will take place in October 2025.

This workshop explores the dual nature of AI in cybersecurity - examining both its potential as a powerful defense tool and its risks when weaponized by malicious actors.
